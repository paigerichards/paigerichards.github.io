                <p>This application was built during my studies for the 'Term 3
                  Major Project', where we were to use React &amp; Node JS.<br><br>
                  The objective was to create something for a company that would
                  be deemed 'useful', though it was to be understood by the company
                  that this was a learning process and the expectation for it to be actually used isn't promised.<br><br>
                  This project, was a group project. My group consisted of three
                  other people, where we all collaborated but specialised in areas. For example, I worked
                  mostly with React, alongside another member of the group and I
                  did all the styling as per the wireframe, though making improvements.<br><br>
                  What is All Needs Transport?<br>
                  All Needs Transport is a delivery company that does contracts with Bunnings, Mac's Furniture
                  &amp; other related companies. It is currently based in Queensland, Victoria.</p>

            During the project we had some problems with the login, however they were resolved.
            We had major issues with the api and data sending through to the backend, at one point &amp;

      </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>This idea for this particular booking app came from where I work.
              I work at a bar and bistro that has bands play every Friday &amp;
              Saturday night.<br><br>
              The idea was to minimise the possiblity of entering data wrong, or
              not completing the full booking. For example currently, the booking
              system is an excel sheet. Feilds, such as payment, date of booking,
              the staff inital of who made the booking and ticket numbers issued
              are common areas to be left blank.<br><br>
              My solution to this was to make this app that requires the data
              entry before officially making the booking. I also wanted to do this
              for refunds and transfers as this is also evidently done incorrectly. <br>
              The first application of this would be adminastration side, with the
              possibility of people being able to book themselves through a mobile app.<br><br>
              The admin will be able to click the ‘booked out‘ button on the particular
              event to shut off bookings to that particular event and to reverse this,
              it would be password protected.<br><br>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
              <p>
              I’ve also allowed the admin to have a print version that will allow
              them to print out all the infomation for each booking, for seating
              purposes, ect. <br><br>
              In the event that the user application did happen, I’ve incorporated
              a notification popup, much like facebook to alert new bookings, where
              the admin would then ‘confirm‘ and the user would be sent an email
              addressing the confirmation of their booking. Upon confirmation is
              when the person will be charged the booking fee. <br>
              On the user application, I styled much like the API of Instagram,
              allowing for easy navigation and addresses the three main pages of the app.<br><br>
              I’ve incorporated a search bar for the admin as this is a major pain
              when sifting through an excel sheet when asked if so and so have
              booked in. This search would also filter through bands, which would
              be primarily the use for the user side app.<br><br>
              Above, you will see wireframe mockups of the application. <br>
              The desktop version is for adminstator and the mobile/ tablet version is for the user.

                  <p> The Idea: I wanted to build an application that would benefit aspiring writers.<br><br>
                    I wanted the users to be able to upload an excerpt of a novel they've written, intrest
                    other users and have the possibility of income with users buying the full versions.<br><br>
                    I wanted to expand this further to job opportunities. I decided that I would
                    integrate a jobs section that would allow users to just click 'apply' and
                    their information would be directly sent to the employer. From there the
                    employer can view all the posts they've made, reviewed and liked. I also
                    wanted to make it a bit more fun with a competition section. <br><br>
                    I firstly restricted these to fields allowing only businesses that sign up being able to make job
                    and competition posts but no novel posts. <br><br>
                    Later, I agreed with feedback that
                    this produced limitations within my app and I decided to give each user the
                    ability to create any type of post, with the decision to sign up as a writer,
                    business or critic was later scrapped. </p>

              <p>Instagram has many great features, the app enables the user to
                search by; location, tags, usernames/actual names, follow users,
                contact them and tag them in posts, either one the user has made
                or in a comment. What appeals me to Instagram is its easy user experience,
                its simplistic and not complicated, quite straightforward. Facebook is
                VERY much simpler. Facebook allows the users to become friends which is
                much like the follow method on Instagram and connect option n LinkedIn.
                One thing that really stuck out about Facebook was its ability to have
                changeable newsfeeds; defaulted and customizable ones by the user.<br><br>

                After looking closely at these two apps, for my app, I'd like the user to be
                able to search specific for the page. For example if they are on the Job's page,
                the will only be given results with jobs relating to the title, experience
                level and location. I also want to implement a follow option, that will then
                give the user a 'following feed' with the root page displaying all users posts.
                This follow option will be found on their profile and will be located next to a
                contact button. Like Facebook, I would like to implement a Top Stories and Most
                Recent newsfeed filter.<br><br>

                I like how all applications use a simplistic icon navigation system
                at the bottom of the screen page on mobile. I would like to keep
                this idea consistent across all screen sizes with possibly having
                the bottom navigation, stick to the right hand side.</p>

              <p>
              Having a look at LinkedIn, I really liked the interface of the profile page.
              I liked the idea of having a round picture with a frame including the person's
              full name, location, connections and beginning of a bio. I'm
              thinking of using a similar design.<br></p>

              <ul>
                <p>The user will be able to have...<br></p>
                  <li>A username, but with the ability to login with email or username</li>
                  <li>A profile picture</li>
                  <li>A record of their posts, reviews and likes accessible from their profile</li>
                  <li>Feed filters, eg; posts, jobs, competitions and top stories and most recent</li>
                  <li>Ability to view other users profiles</li>
                  <li>Ability to follow a user</li>
                  <li>Ability to contact user</li>
                  <li>Ability to apply for jobs and competitions</li>
                  <li>Search specific to the page</li>
                  <li>Ability to buy full versions of novels</li>
                  <li>Ability to like a post</li>
                  <li>Ability to review and rate a post</li>
                  <li>Ability to report inappropriate comments</li>
                  <li>Ability to see overall rate of a post</li>
                  <li>Biography</li>
              </ul>
              <p><br>
              I'm more leaning to creating my app with a closely feel of Instagram
              for the as I feel like the design in place is more inviting than
              Facebook and Linkedin with its use of color.</p>
