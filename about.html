        <p> I've just completed an Internship with Hitori App Development,
           a start up that is dedicated in creating applications for clients with
           effective usability and also creating promotional websites and marketing
           schemes to influence more users.<br><br>
           My tasks at Hitori for the past 3 weeks have included website and
           application bug fixes, improvements  to functionality, look and feel.
           In addition, I  have also done some graphic design work here,
           creating flyers for their independent apps.<br><br>
           This Internship is the completion unit of the curriculum at the
           Coder Academy where I’m enrolled in a ‘fast track’ bootcamp, studying
           a Diploma of Information Technology. During the past 6 months I have
           become familiar with Ruby, Ruby on Rails, NodeJS, ReactJS, Bootstrap,
           Sass and have received an even deeper understanding of HTML &amp; CSS
           first taught in previous studies. I also began to grasp the conventions
           of SQL and MongoDB databases.<br><br>
           Last year, I studied at Tractor Design School where I was enrolled in
           a Diploma of Graphic Design and a Diploma of Web Development. During
           my time, I gained skills in the Adobe Suite; specifically Illustrator,
           Photoshop and InDesign, and have since continued using these applications.
           I was also introduced to HTML &amp; CSS and Axure RP for the first time,
           and developed a passion for code and web design. I came to understand
           the importance of UX and UI including Grid Systems &amp; Responsive Design,
           Style Guides, SEO and Trunk &amp; User Testing. Assignments included
           documenting tasks efficiently, with user journeys and completing
           projects specific to the clients specifications, e.g.; links to social
           media. During my time I completed Typography, Branding, Photography,
           Software Skills, UX, Drawing and Web Development classes/units.
           Unfortunately, my time here was cut short due to government funding,
           forcing closure of the institution. However, over the course of the
           12 months, I completed all but 2 units that was to roll over to the
           following year. I’m currently enquiring to complete this online.<br><br>
           I’m eager to get straight into full-time work doing something I have
           a passion for, and will enjoy. I believe I would be a great assest to
           a workplace, as I have strong attention to detail, have a creative mind
           that’s open to new ideas and have the ability to work as an individual
           and as a part of a team, where compromises, suggestions and critics are
           made to ultimately better the product at hand. In addition I think it
           would be a great opportunity for me to showcase my skills and a great
           opportunity to learn more.</p>
